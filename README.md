This is spring equivalent of Trisha Gee's html5-angularjs-groovy-java-and-mongodb-all-together-what-could-go-wrong talk.
Please refer below resources for more info:

Web application demoed at conferences.  See history for how it builds up, and check out the branches to see different versions presented at different conferences.

There's a [page on my blog](http://trishagee.github.io/presentation/angularjs_html5_groovy_java_mongodb_wcpgw/) where I collate all the videos and blog posts about this presentation, but the key points are:

 - An interview describing the motivation behind this project in [this blog post](http://trishagee.github.io/presentation/interview_at_goto_chicago/).
 - The Groovy script that imports data into MongoDB has been dissected in 
[this blog post](http://trishagee.github.io/post/groovy_import_to_mongodb/).
 - There's a recording of the 
[Virtual User Group Session](http://virtualjug.com/html5-angularjs-groovy-java-and-mongodb-all-together-what-could-go-wrong/), 
where you can see this application being built "live"
